# Malaria-Detection
Detecting Malaria infections from images of cells using Convolutional Neural Network as a classifier.


File Information:

- Malaria_Detection_Classifier.ipynb is the main script, which documents the process undertaken to build the image classifier.
- The CSV files included in the 'Accuracy:Loss Data' folder contain a log of the accuracy values and log-loss values obtained during the training of each classifier model.
- The .h5 files inculded in the 'Saved Model Weights' folder contain the final CNN model weights from each tested classifer model.
- The 'images' folder simply contains the header image for the main notebook.

NOTE: The actual test images are not included within this repository, however they can be accessed and downloaded from here: https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria
